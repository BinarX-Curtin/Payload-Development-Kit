## PCB Fabrication

Ordering the main PCB is easy and should only take a few minutes.

1. Download the latest Gerber files `Binar.Payload.Development.Kit.Gerber.Files.Only.<Day>.<Month>.<Year>.zip` from https://github.com/BinarX-Curtin/Payload-Development-Kit/releases/.
2. Head to your favourite PCB fabricator such as [JLCPCB](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote), [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/orderonline.aspx) or Oshpark](https://oshpark.com/).
3. Browse or Drag and drop the .zip file of Gerbers into the online order form of the PCB fabricator to order.

   We reccomend selecting the following options:
   - PCB Thickness: 1.6 mm
   - Surface Finish: ENIG (Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold)
5. If making more than a couple of boards, we recommend also ordering an electropolished stencil.

## Component Procurement
1. Download the latest full release `Binar.Payload.Development.Kit.<Day>.<Month>.<Year>.zip` from https://github.com/BinarX-Curtin/Payload-Development-Kit/releases/.
2. Find the Bill of Materials in `Assembly SPI and UART\BOM`. (.pdf and .xlxs formats are provided).
3. Order the components listed on the Bill of Materials from the suppliers listed or your preferred suppliers. We commonly order components from:

   - [Mouser](https://mouser.com/)
   - [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com)
   - [element14](https://au.element14.com/) ([Farnell or Newark in other regions](https://www.farnell.com/))

## PCB Assembly

Assemble the PCB using either the stencil and solder paste method for the SMD components followed by hand soldering of the throughhole components or by hand soldering all components.
