# Payload-Development-Kit
This repository contains the design files, documentation and manufacturing outputs to produce the Binar Payload Development Kit hardware which is used for developing spacecraft payloads compatible with Binar spacecraft.

## Binar and BinarX
Binar (BIN-ah) is the Noongar word for “fireball”. We’re a space program, building the next generation of Australian small spacecraft, at Curtin University’s Space Science and Technology Centre. BinarX is a two year program supporting high school students to design and build their own spacecraft payloads to fly on future Binar spacecraft.

You can learn more about the space program and BinarX on our website: https://www.binarspace.com/binarx/.
