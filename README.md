# Payload-Development-Kit
This repository contains the design files, documentation and manufacturing outputs to produce the Binar Payload Development Kit hardware which is used for developing spacecraft payloads compatible with Binar spacecraft.

## Binar and BinarX
Binar (BIN-ah) is the Noongar word for fireball. Weâ€™re a space program, building the next generation of Australian small spacecraft, at Curtin University's Space Science and Technology Centre. BinarX is a two year program supporting high school students to design and build their own spacecraft payloads to fly on future Binar spacecraft.

You can learn more about the Binar Space Program and our BinarX payload development program on our website: https://www.binarspace.com/binarx/.

## Getting Started
I you have a Binar Payload Development Kit already, please see [Parts-List.md](Parts-List.md) for a list of additional components you may need to procure to get started with payload development. If don't have a Kit and you need to procure one, please see [Fabrication-and-Assembly.md](Fabrication-and-Assembly.md) for information on how to order and assemble your own development kit.
