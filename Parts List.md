## Payload Development Kit Main PCB
The main PCB provides the connectivity between the payload under development and the microcontroller development board (dev board) running the Binar Spacecraft Emulator Software. It also provides connections for power from either a benchtop or 2.1 mm centre positive barrel jack power supply and a STLINK debugger for programming the payload.

If you have been provided with a Binar Payload Development Kit by the Binar Space Program, you already have this component.

If you haven't been provided with a kit, you can find instructions for ordering and assembling the main PCB here: [Fabrication and Assembly.md](Fabrication and Assembly.md).

## STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H743ZI2 Microcontroller Development Board
The [STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H743ZI2 Development Board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h743zi.html) is a microcontroller development board for the [STM32H743ZIT6](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32h743zi.html) STM32 family microcontroller. It plugs into the four 0.1" header receptacles at the top of the Payload Development Kit Main PCB and runs the Binar Spacecraft Emulator Software which simulates the operation of the Binar spacecraft during the development of your payload.

If you have been provided with a Binar Payload Development Kit by the Binar Space Program, you already have this component and it is already plugged into your Payload Development Kit Main PCB. It will also already have been flashed with the Binar Spacecraft Emulator Software.

If you haven't been provided with a kit, you will need to source the STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H743ZI2 Microcontroller Development Board and flash it with the Binar Spacecraft Emulator Software yourself.
