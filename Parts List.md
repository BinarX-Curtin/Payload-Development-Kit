## Payload Development Kit Main PCB

The main PCB provides the connectivity between the payload under development and the microcontroller development board (dev board) running the Binar Spacecraft Emulator Software. It also provides connections for power from either a benchtop power suply or DC power supply with a 2.1 mm centre positive barrel jack and a debugger to the payload board (if using the using the 20 pin one piece connector for programming).
