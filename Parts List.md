## Payload Development Kit Main PCB
The main PCB provides the connectivity between the payload under development and the microcontroller development board (dev board) running the Binar Spacecraft Emulator Software. It also provides connections for power from either a benchtop or 2.1 mm centre positive barrel jack power supply and a STLINK debugger for programming the payload.

If you have been provided with a Binar Payload Development Kit by the Binar Space Program, you already have this component. If you haven't been provided with a kit, you can find instructions for ordering and assembling the main PCB here: [Fabrication and Assembly.md](Fabrication and Assembly.md).
